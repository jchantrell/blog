        <p>Hi, I'm Joel. ðŸ‘‹</p>
        <p>
          I'm an engineer and tinkerer that's been inseparable from computers since I was a child. I work professionally
          as a software engineer and do a lot of recreational programming in my spare time. I use this website to
          document my thoughts, learnings and what I'm working on.
