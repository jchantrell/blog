# jchantrell.dev

This is a personal website that's built with [Astro](https://astro.build/).

It has a landing page with contact details, a blog, a list of personal projects and a CV/resume. I update it on an ad-hoc basis and occasionally use it as a playground for new ideas.

## Can I use this?

Of course. The project and all of its dependencies are either MIT or Apache-2.0 licensed, so feel free to fork and do as you wish. Just remember to update your details in `src/content/data.ts` so you don't end up impersonating me. 🙈

## What commands do I need?

```bash
pnpm dev # run locally
pnpm build # production build
pnpm preview # preview the production build
```
